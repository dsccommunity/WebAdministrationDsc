### Examples

You can review the [Examples](/source/Examples) directory in the WebAdministration module
for some general use scenarios for all of the resources that are in the module.

The resource examples are also available in the [WebAdministration Wiki](https://github.com/dsccommunity/WebAdministrationDsc/wiki).

### Registering PHP

When configuring an IIS Application that uses PHP, you first need to register the PHP CGI module with IIS.
The following **xPhp** configuration downloads and installs the prerequisites for PHP, downloads PHP, registers the PHP CGI module with IIS and sets the system environment variable that PHP needs to run.

Note: This example is intended to be used as a composite resource, so it does not use Configuration Data.
Please see the [Composite Configuration Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2014/02/25/reusing-existing-configuration-scripts-in-powershell-desired-state-configuration.aspx) on how to use this configuration in another configuration.

## Installation

### From GitHub source code

To manually install the module, download the source code from GitHub and unzip
the contents to the '$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules' folder.

### From PowerShell Gallery

To install from the PowerShell gallery using PowerShellGet (in PowerShell 5.0)
run the following command:

```powershell
Find-Module -Name WebAdministrationDsc | Install-Module
```

To confirm installation, run the below command and ensure you see the
DSC resources available:

```powershell
Get-DscResource -Module WebAdministrationDsc
```

## Requirements

The minimum Windows Management Framework (PowerShell) version required is
4.0 or higher.

>Note: In the CI pipeline the resource are only tested on PowerShell 5.1,
>so PowerShell 4.0 support is best effort as this time.
